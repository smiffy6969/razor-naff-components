# Razor NAFF Web Components


__Browser Support__ - IE9+, Chrome, FF, Safari, Opera


Razor NAFF Web Components are a set of web components aimed at simplifying the development of web sites/applications. They consist of sets of native custom web components that utilise the razor-naff helper library, they can be used as simply as adding the component import (.html), then using the new custom element wherever and whenever you like in your html.

The web components are not built on top of any framework, they are built natively using JS and only require webcomponentsjs [https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs] for polyfilling support for web components and the naff helper library [TBD] for internal workings of the component (this can also be used to build your page application too!).

The web components can be used with vanilla JS, jQuery, or used with frameworks such as angularJS, Polymer or X-tags.

This set of web components is work in progress, so please expect bugs and a limited amount of components to begin with, as I find the need for more i will add them. This collection was created to stop the need to continually iterate over the same age old problems of extending HTML for application development.


## Installation  


It is best to install the components via [Bower](http://bower.io/) in order to satisfy all dependencies (razor-naff, webcomponentsjs, promise, font-awesome), in such cases where you wish to install manually, I suggest you take a peek at the **bower.json** file to satisfy dependences listed under the dependencies section manually. Please ensure when installing manually, that correct directory structure is adhered to as per [github](https://github.com) (as the dependencies are structured on github), with all components being placed in a shared folder (called bower_components maybe?).

You may use the --save flag to store installation info in a central project bower.json file, if you do not have one already, you can do this first.


```
bower init
```


Installing is simple via bower in the command line, from your project root folder...


```
bower install razor-naff-components --save
```


following the instructions to build your bower.json, alternatively you can just copy one from another project and change it manually.


## Setup


In order to use the web components, it is first best practice to include the polyfills for unsupported API's in browsers, and the razor-naff helper library. This is done through the webcomponentsjs suite of polyfills (or you can find your own maybe like x-tags) and promise polyfill, as you installed razor-naff-components via bower, you will already have these pulled into the project, so all the hard work is done, just include it in your head section of your HTML along with polymer (this too was pulled in). You will need to include the bundled version of naff to include support for data binding


```html
<script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/promise-polyfill/Promise.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/razor-naff/naff.bundled.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bower_components/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```


Now we have the polyfills and helper library in place, it is your choice as to how you import the web components you need. We are going to do this using the spiffy new HTML import, which imports HTML files and get this, it only does it once regardless of how many times you add the import. This is great as we can specify dependencies in each component to ensure we have what we need for it, without impacting on performance or double loading of dependencies.

The web components are split into groups, so we can either import the whole lot in one fell swoop without the need to worry about if you have imported something (great for dev work), or we import a group as we need it on a per app/page basis...


```html
<link rel="import" href="components/razor-naff-components/build/naff.vulc.html">
```


Now you can just use any component you like, each dependency will only be loaded once, where components use other components. If you only want one component or group of compoents, you can import the group.


```html
<link rel="import" href="components/razor-naff-components/build/naff-base.vulc.html">
```


# Usage


Using the web components is as simple as writing HTML, all the components come with there own logic and style, with all access and usage being through the attributes or the 'scope' property on the element. razor-naff-components not designed to be used with other web component frameworks, however they will function just fine in any environment that does not apply any shadow dom to its host element (as styling logic will not bleed in). This is due to limitations with polyfills for shadow dom and the lack of native shadow dom support at present.

For details on how to use the web components, please see the applicable index file in demo folder. All web components can be manipulated via html attribute or JS by altering raw html element scope `document.querySelector('naff-test').scope`.

The components are split into groups, with a distinction between extended components that simply extend an exisiting element using the is="" attribute, and custom components.


## Base Components


### naff-icon (naff-base)


```html
<naff-icon name="" size="" rotate="" flip="" border spin pulse inverse fw></naff-icon>
```


All icons are supplied via [font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) all we do is abstract out the different class names allowing you to add them as attirbutes (better for binding tools), thes are then written to the class as a name (or you can alter the class directly). Basically this component allows you to use a dedicate icon tag instead of the 'i' tag which is not meant for icons really. For a full list of icons available please see their site. NOTE: you can add the attribute 'spin' to make icons spin. Styling can be applied direct to the element via standard css means, or you can have control via attributes such as size="2".


Please ensure you have added your style tag in your head for fontawesome before using!


* __name__ - The icon to use as per font-awesome list (without the need for 'fa-' we only need the icon name).
* __size__ - The size as per font-awesome docs lg, 2, 3, 4, 5.
* __rotate__ - The orientation of the icon reotated from the current position such as 90, 80, 270.
* __flip__ - The orientation of the icon flipped across an axis such as horizontal, vertical.
* __border__ - Apply a border to the icon.
* __spin__ - Make the icon spin.
* __pulse__ - Make the icon spin in steps.
* __inverse__ - Invert the icon color (white icon).
* __fw__ - Set the icon to a fixed width (great for aligning icons).


### naff-tag (naff-base)


```html
<naff-tag shape="" size="" color=""></naff-tag>
```


Adds a tag with the contents being shown in a colored box in several shapes, use this for highlighting text.


* __size__ - The size as extra-small, small, medium, large, extra-large.
* __shape__ - The shape as round, rounded, oval or square.
* __color__ - The color as grey, blue, red, green, orange, black, pink, purple, yellow, aqua, white.


## Form Components

```html
<button is="naff-x-button" size="" color="" shape="" disabled></button>
```

### naff-x-form (naff-form)


```html
<form is="naff-x-form" error></form>
```


Adds some goodies to form element, any naff-form element used inside an extended form element using naff-x-form that has validation regex set will be checked by this form when any value changes.
The form will set the error attribute when any naff-form element errors or is required and empty (skipping disabled ones) to allow you to easily error check your form contents in one go. Please note only naff-form custom elements will be checked.


* __error__ - Set to 1 for an error and 0 for ok.


__events__


* __error__ - Fired when an error in naff-form element validation occurs.
* __ok__ - Fired when no error is found in naff-form element validation.

### naff-input (naff-form)


```html
<naff-input name="testName" type="text" value="hello" placeholder="Type Something" match="Text to match" match-message="does not match" validate="^(\s*|[0-9-]+)$" validateMessage="Numbers only dude!" disabled error></naff-input>
```


A more advanced input with intgral error checking, validating values entered to regex supplied and outputting a message under the input on failure. In addition to validation, you may also send in an additional match attribute, meaning you can have validation, and if pass, will then move on to ensure matches the match value. This is great for email and password confirmation by using naff-match="" to send in the password to confirm against for the confirmation input. Sets error on validation or match fail.


* __name__ - The name of the form input.
* __type__ - The type of form input just like a normal input element.
* __value__ - The value of of the live input just like a normal input element.

* __matchMessage__ - Message to show if match is set and validation passes, good for confirming things like emails or passwords.
* __validate__ - A regex to validate to.
* __validateMessage__ - Message to show under input when error happens.
* __disabled__ - Disables the input.
* __error__ - Set to 1 for an error and 0 for ok, add this attribute manually to force check on load.


__events__


* __changed__ - Fired when a change to the input value is complete.
* __keypress__ - Fired when a key is pressed, returning the event of the keypress.

    </footer>
</naff-modal>
```


A modal box positioned centrally on the screen that auto adjusts height, setting width to 50% of the window (and 90% when mobile view). When visible, the modal will show at 50% width by default (or you can change in css) with height auto set to wrap contents or add scroll bar when reaching the limit of the browser window, adapting this to mobiles with a force full on devices less than 500px wide. You can place optional heading content to apply a heading to the modal with a close icon, or footer content. Main content is required and will auto size based on contents.


* __toggle__ - The visibility of the modal in real time as 0 or 1. Change this value to show or hide the modal.


__content__

### naff-partial (naff-resource)


```html
<naff-partial basepath="application/my-partials" partial="partial-one"></naff-partial>
```


A partial loader to load content from a html file (html extension only) and render the contents in the element. On change of attributes, reload of partial happens meaning this can be used in conjunction with routing to create single page apps with multiple traversable app pages (without reload, see naff getLocation/setLocation for app routing). Only works for same domain loading and requires javascript embedded tags to be swapped for html import with embedded script tags to promote loading of script from partial.

example of partial dependancy resolution, inside your partial html file (load js as html import with js embedded inside html script tags)

```html
<!-- partial dependancies -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="....../style.css">
<link rel="import" href="...../logic.js.html">

<div>
    <!-- stuff here in partial -->
</div>
```


* __basepath__ - The base path for all your partials.
* __partial__ - The partial to load (without the .html part) this must resolve to a .html file and can include sub folders


__events__


* __loaded__ - Fired when partial hase finished being rendered onto screen.
* __[attribute_name]attributechanged__ - Fired when a change to the attribute happens, contains detail of changes.


__methods__


* __scope.load()__ - Loads the modal based on internal reference of basepath and partial, use attributes to change these values and prmote auto load.


### naff-menu (naff-structure)


```html
<naff-menu logo-text="hello" children="expandable" position="left" default-route="one" menu-items='[{"route":"one","label":"One long menu item","icon":"trash","menuItems":[]},...'></naff-menu>
```


Displays a mobile friendly left/right hand menu that takes up full length of the screen. When screen shrinks to mobile layout, menu changes to top menu with toggle menu icon. Menus can be nested up to 5 children and can also have navigable or benign parents (by omiting the route completely). To finsh off, you can add logo text that will automatically direct the user to default-route. Style the menu directly to have alter color, font etc. Data can either be set on menu-items attribute as a valid JSON string (by using single quotes as the menu-items attribute quotes, e.g. menu-items='[{...}]') or can be set by altering the elements scope.menuItems to a valid array containing objects for each menu item. Use this in conjunction with naff-page to create a basic page structure of menu and page area.


* __side-logo__ - Path to a logo image to use in menu when showing side menu.
* __side-logo-text__ - Any logo text to display under logo and above menu when showing side menu.
* __top-logo__ - Path to a logo image to use in top menu when showing top menu.
* __top-logo-text__ - Any logo text to display after logo when showing top menu.
* __children__ - Set to expandable to have child menu items hidden until parent is clicked.
* __position__ - Place menu on left or right side of the screen.
* __default-route__ - The default route to go to when none is set i.e. your home page.
* __menu-items__ - The menu items to display as a JSON string, use single quotes for menu-items='' to ensure you get a valid JSON string.


__events__


* __[attribute_name]attributechanged__ - Fired when a change to the attribute happens, contains detail of changes.


__properties__


* __scope.toggle__ - The status of the menu icon toggle when in mobile view.
* __scope.menuItems__ - The menu items to display as an array of objects containing label, route [optional], icon [optional], menuItems [optional] (use same structure for child menus).


### naff-page (naff-structure)


```html
<naff-page position="right"></naff-page>
```


Works along side naff-menu to provide an area for page/application content to be placed. Places content in a scrollable area that adapts to mobile views along with naff-menu. Set to left or right side of page when menu is always visible.


* __position__ - Place page on left or right side of the screen.
